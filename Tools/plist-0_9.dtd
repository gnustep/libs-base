     Not all unicode characters are legal in PCDATA in XML,
     so an escape mechanism is provided.  A string containing
     a sequence of the form \UXXXX or \uXXXX (where XXXX is a
     hexadecimal number) will be replaced by the appropriate
     unicode character after the property list is parsed.
