.SH NAME
cvtenc \- file encoding converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvtenc
[\fB-Encoding\fR \fIencoding\fR]
[\fB-EscapeIn\fR \fIyes|NO\fR]
[\fB-EscapeOut\fR \fIyes|NO\fR]
 \fIfilename\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Converts a file encoded in a specified or default non-unicode encoding to
unicode, or, if the file is already in unicode, converts it to a specified
or default non-unicode encoding.  The converted text is printed to standard
out.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-Encoding\fR \fI encoding\fR" 4
Specify non-unicode encoding to be used.  The direction of conversion depends
on whether the file given as input is recognized as unicode (from the higher
order bytes).  To get a list of available encodings, enter "list" for the
encoding.  If this is not specified, the default encoding for the current
locale is used.
.IP "\fB\-EscapeIn\fR \fIYES|NO\fR" 4
Specify '-EscapeIn YES' (the default is 'NO') to parse the input for \\u
escape sequences (as in property lists).
.IP "\fB\-EscapeOut\fR \fIYES|NO\fR" 4
Specify '-EscapeOut YES' (the default is 'NO') to generate \\u escape
sequences (as in property lists) in the output.  Note, this might produce
unexpected results for some encodings.
