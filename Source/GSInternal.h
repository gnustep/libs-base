/* This file defines macros for managing internal (hidden) instance variables
 * of a public class so that users of the public class don't need to recompile
 * their code when the class implementation is changed in new versions of the
 * library.
 *
 * The public class MUST declare its instance variables (after any public
 * instance variables which are part of the unchanging public API) using
 * code of the form:
 * #if	GS_NONFRAGILE
 * #  if defined(GS_X_IVARS)
 * @public GS_X_IVARS;
 * #  endif
 * #else
 * @private id _internal GS_UNUSED_IVAR;
 * #endif
 *
 * In the non fragile case, this means that the public header has nothing
 * visible, but the ivars defined in GS_X_IVARS are visible within the
 * implementation.
 *
 * In the fragile case, the '_internal' instance variable is visible in the
 * public header, but as an opaque private instance variable, while macros
 * from this file allow the actual memory to be accessed either as a private
 * class.  The use of a private class rather than simple heap memory is
 * necessary for automatic reference counting.
 *
 * Before including the header file containing the public class declaration,
 * you must define GS_X_IVARS (where X is the class name) to be the
 * list of actual instance variable declarations for the class.
 *
 * Before including this file, you must define 'GSInternal' to be the name
 * of your public class with * 'Internal' appended.
 * eg. if your class is called 'MyClass' then use the following define:
 * #define GSInternal MyClassInternal
 *
 * After including this file you can use the GS_PRIVATE_INTERNAL() macro
 * to declare the private subclass used to hold real instance variables.
 * The argument to this macro is the public class name (the GS_X_IVARS
 * list must also be defined).
 *
 * You use GS_CREATE_INTERNAL() in your intialiser to create the object
 * holding the internal instance variables, and GS_DESTROY_INTERNAL() to
 * get rid of that object  in your -dealloc method.
 * You use GS_COPY_INTERNAL() in your implementations of -copyWithZone:
 * and -mutableCopyWithZone: in order to get the default copying behavior
 * for the internal class (a single copy of all the instance variables).
 *
 * Instance variables are referenced using the 'internal->ivar' suntax or
 * the GSIV(classname,object,ivar) macro.
 *
