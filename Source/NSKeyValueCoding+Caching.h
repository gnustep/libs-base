/**
 * It turns out that valueForKey: is a very expensive operation, and a major
 * bottleneck for Key-Value Observing and other operations such as sorting
 * an array by key.
 *
 * The accessor search patterns for Key-Value observing are discussed in the
 * Apple Key-Value Coding Programming Guide. The return value may be
 * encapuslated into an NSNumber or NSValue object, depending on the Objective-C
 * type encoding of the return value. This means that once valueForKey: found an
 * existing accessor, the Objective-C type encoding of the accessor is
 * retrieved. We then go through a huge switch case to determine the right way
 * to invoke the IMP and potentially encapsulate the return type. The resulting
 * object is then returned.
 * The algorithm for setValue:ForKey: is similar.
 *
 * We can speed this up by caching the IMP of the accessor in a hash table.
 * However, without proper versioning, this quickly becomes very dangerous.
 * The user might exchange implementations, or add new ones expecting the
 * search pattern invariant to still hold. If we clamp onto an IMP, this
 * invariant no longer holds.
 *
 * We will make use of libobjc2's safe caching to avoid this.
 *
 * Note that the caching is opaque. You will only need to redirect all
 * valueForKey: calls to the function below.
