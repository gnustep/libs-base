/*
 *	The 'GSRunLoopWatcher' class was written to permit the (relatively)
 *	easy addition of new events to be watched for in the runloop.
 *
 *	To add a new type of event, the 'RunLoopEventType' enumeration must be
 *	extended, and the methods must be modified to handle the new type.
 *
 *	The internal variables if the GSRunLoopWatcher are used as follows -
 *
 *	If '_invalidated' is set, the watcher should be disabled and should
 *	be removed from the runloop when next encountered.
 *
 *	If 'checkBlocking' is set, the run loop should ask the watcher
 *	whether it should block and/or trigger each loop iteration.
 *
 *	The 'data' variable is used to identify the  resource/event that the
 *	watcher is interested in.  Its meaning is system dependent.
 *
 *	The 'receiver' is the object which should be told when the event
 *	occurs.  This object is NOT retained so that we can avoid retain
 *	loops.  It is the responsibility of the receiver to invalidate
 *	the watcher before it is destroyed.
 *
 *	The 'type' variable indentifies the type of event watched for.
 *	NSRunLoops [-acceptInputForMode: beforeDate: ] method MUST contain
 *	code to watch for events of each type.
 *
 *	NB.  This class is private to NSRunLoop and must not be subclassed.
