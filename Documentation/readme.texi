The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).  

@section Initial reading

The file @samp{NEWS} has the library's feature history.

The files @samp{INSTALL} or @samp{GNUstep-HOWTO} (from the web site)
gives instructions for installing the library.

Note that releases numbers that have an odd minor version (e.g. 1.3.2)
are unstable releases. They are not as well tested as stable releases
(e.g. 1.4.1).

@section License

The GNUstep libraries are covered under the GNU Lesser Public License.
This means you can use these libraries in any program (even non-free
programs). If you distribute the libraries along with your program, 
you must make the improvements you have made

With GNUstep-Base, we strongly recommend the use of the ffcall
libraries, which provides stack frame handling for NSInvocation and
NSConnection.  "Ffcall is under GNU GPL. As a special exception, if used
in GNUstep or in derivate works of GNUstep, the included parts of ffcall
are under GNU LGPL" (Text in quotes provided by the author of ffcall).
