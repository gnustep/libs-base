@chapter Base Library
@cindex base library

The GNUstep Base library is an implementation of the OpenStep @i{Foundation},
a nongraphical API supporting for data management, network and file
interaction, date and time handling, and more.  Much of the API consists of
classes with defined methods, but unlike many ``class libraries'' it also
includes functions and macros when these are more appropriate to the
functionality.

Note that many other APIs developed subsequently to OpenStep are also called
``Foundation'' -- the Java standard classes and the Microsoft Windows C++
class library are two prominent examples.  In OpenStep, however, the term only
applies to a non-graphical library; the graphical component is referred to as
the @i{Application Kit}, or ``AppKit'' for short.

Although the OpenStep API underwent several refactorings subsequent to its
first release as part of NeXTstep, deprecated and superseded classes and
functions have not been retained.  Therefore the library still boasts a
minimal footprint for its functionality.

In some cases, GNUstep has supplemented the OpenStep API, not to provide
alternative means of achieving the same goals, but to add new functionality,
usually relating to technology that did not exist when the OpenStep
specification was finalized, but has not, for whatever reason, been added by
Apple to the Cocoa APIs.  These additions are called, appropriately enough,
the @i{Base Additions} library, and include classes, functions, and macros.
XML parsing facilities, for example, are provided as part of this library.

In addition, methods are sometimes added to Foundation classes.  These are
specially marked in the documentation and can even be excluded at compile time
(a warning will be generated if you try to use them) if you are writing code
intended to be ported to OpenStep or Cocoa compliant systems.  In addition,
Cocoa has made additions to OpenStep and these are marked as ``MacOS-X''.  For
information on how to set compile flags, see @ref{Compliance to Standards}.

In deciding whether to use a given API, you need to weigh the likelihood you
will need to port the application to a platform where it will not be
available, and in that case, how much effort would be required to do without
the API.  If you are aiming for full portability from the start (only a
recompile needed), then you should of course avoid APIs that will not be
available.  However in other cases it can be better to use whichever APIs are
best suited initially so that early development and debugging will be as
efficient as possible -- as long as major redesign would not be required to
later avoid these APIs.

Below, the Base and Base Additions APIs are covered in overview fashion,
organized according to functionality.  For detailed documentation on
individual classes and functions, you should consult the GSDoc API references
for @uref{../Reference/index.html, Base} and
@uref{../../BaseAdditions/Reference/index.html, Base Additions}.  It may be
helpful, when reading this chapter, to keep a copy of this open in another
browser window for reference.


@section Copying, Comparing, Hashing Objects

Often in object-oriented code you need to make a duplicate copy of an existing
object.  The @code{NSObject} method @code{-(id) copy} provides a standard
means of acquiring a copy of the object.  The @i{depth} of the copy is not
defined.  That is, if an object has instance variables or other references to
other objects, they may either themselves be copied or just the references to
them will be copied.  The root class @code{NSObject} does @i{not} implement
the copy method directly; instead it calls the @code{-copyWithZone} method,
which is the sole method defined in the @code{@i{NSCopying}} informal
protocol.  @code{NSObject} does not implement this protocol.  If you want
objects of your class to support copying, you must implement this method
yourself.  If it is not implemented, the @code{-copy} method will raise an
exception if you call it.

There is a related method @code{-(id) mutableCopy} (and an
@code{@i{NSMutableCopying}} informal protocol with a
@code{mutableCopyWithZone} method) which will be explained in the following
section.

GNUstep, largely via the @code{NSObject} class, provides a basic framework for
comparing objects for equality and ordering, used for sorting, indexing, and
other programming tasks.  These operations are also used in several crucial
places elsewhere within the base library itself.  For example, containers such
as lists, sets, and hash maps are discussed in the next section utilize these
methods.

The @code{- (BOOL) isEqual} method in @code{NSObject} is useful when you want to
compare objects with one another:

@example
if ([anObject isEqual: anotherObject])
  @{
    // do something ...
  @}
@end example

The default implementation returns @code{YES} only if the two objects being
compared are the exact same object (which is the same as the result that would
be returned using '@code{==}' to perform the comparison).  Sometimes it is
useful to have two objects to be equal if their internal state is the same, as
reflected in instance variables, for example.  In this case, you can override
@code{isEqual} in your class to perform such a comparison.

The @code{-(unsigned int)hash} method is useful for indexing objects, and
should return the same value for two objects of the same class that
@code{isEqual} each other.  The same reasoning applies as for the
@code{isEqual} method -- if you want this to depend on internal state rather
than the identity of the object itself, override it.  The default @code{hash}
value is based on the memory address occupied by the object.

The @code{-(NSComparisonResult) compare: (id)object} method is used in Cocoa
for comparing objects.  It should return @code{NSOrderedAscending} if the
receiver is less than the argument, @code{NSOrderedDescending} if it is
greater, otherwise @code{NSOrderedSame}.  Note that this is not meaningful
for many types of objects, and is actually deprecated in GNUstep for this
reason.

The @code{-(NSString *) description} method in @code{NSObject} returns a
short description of the object, often used for debugging.  The default
implementation lists the object's class and memory location.  If you want
other information you can override it.

The methods discussed in this section are all very similar to counterparts in
Java: the @code{equals} and @code{hashCode} methods, and the
@code{@i{Comparable}} interface.


@section Object Containers

GNUstep defines three major utility classes for holding collections of other
objects.  @code{NSArray} is an ordered collection of objects, each of which
may occur in the collection multiple times.  @code{NSSet} is an unordered
collection of unique objects (according to @code{isEqual} and/or @code{hash}).
@code{NSDictionary} is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.  The keys
form a set (and must be unique), however there are no restrictions on the
collection of values.  The @code{-hash} and @code{-isEqual} @code{NSObject}
methods discussed above are used by collection instances to organize their
members.  All collections @code{retain} their members (see @ref{Objects}).

Unlike container APIs in some other languages, notably Java, instances of
these GNUstep classes are all @i{immutable} -- once created, you cannot add or
remove from them.  If you need the ability to make changes (often the case),
use the mutable classes @code{NSMutableArray}, @code{NSMutableSet}, and
@code{NSMutableDictionary}.  The @code{-mutableCopy} method mentioned in the
previous section will return the mutable version of a container regardless of
whether the original was mutable or not.  Likewise, the @code{-copy} method
returns an immutable version.  You should generally use immutable variants of
objects when you don't need to modify them, because their implementations are
more efficient.  Often it is worthwhile to convert a mutable object that has
just been built into an immutable one if it is going to be heavily accessed.

Also unlike container objects in Java, GNUstep containers possess utility
methods.  For example, Arrays can sort their members, or send a message to
each member individually (like the @code{map} function in Lisp).  Sets can
determine whether they are equal to or subsets of other sets.  Dictionaries
can save to and restore themselves from specially formatted files.

In addition to the three container types already mentioned, there is a
fourth, @code{NSCountedSet}.  This is an unordered collection whose elements
need not be unique, however the number of times a given unique element has
been added is tracked.  This behavior is also known as @i{bag} semantics.

All collection classes support returning an @code{NSEnumerator} object which
will enumerate over the elements of the collection.  Note that if a mutable
collection is modified while an enumerator is being used, the results are not
defined.

Collections do not allow @code{nil} values or keys, but you can explicitly
represent a nil object using the special @code{NSNull} class.  You simply use
the singleton returned from @code{[NSNull null]}.

The four container types just described handle objects, but not primitives
such as @code{float} or @code{int}.  For this, you must use an
@code{NSHashTable} or @code{NSMapTable}.  Despite their names, these are not
classes, but data types.  A set of functions is defined for dealing with them.
Each can store and retrieve arbitrary pointers keyed by other arbitrary
pointers.  However you are responsible for implementing the hashing yourself.
To create an @code{NSHashTable}, use the function @code{NSCreateHashtable}.
@code{NSHashInsert} and @code{NSHashGet} are the major functions, but there
are many others.  There is a mostly parallel but more sophisticated set of
functions dealing with @code{NSMapTables}.
@ignore
Need to explain why NSHashTable and NSMapTable are not classes, if there is a
good reason for it, or else make excuses for why it is the (at first glance
rather crappy) way it is...
@end ignore


@section Data and Number Containers

The data containers discussed in the previous section, with the exception of
@code{NSHashTable} and @code{NSMapTable}, can store objects, but not primitive
types such as @code{int}s or @code{float}s.  The @code{NS...Table} structures
are not always appropriate for a given task.  For this case, GNUstep offers
two alternatives.

@subsection NSData

The @code{NSData} and @code{NSMutableData} classes manage a buffer of bytes as
an object.  The contents of the buffer can be anything that can be stored in
memory, a 4-dimensional array of @code{double} for example (stored as a linear
sequence).  Optionally, objects of these classes can take care of the memory
management for the buffer, growing it as needed and freeing it when they are
released.

@subsection NSValue

The @code{NSValue} class can wrap a single primitive value as an object so it
can be used in the containers and other places where an object reference is
needed.  Once initialized, an @code{NSValue} is immutable, and there is no
@code{NSMutableValue} class.  You initialize it by giving it a pointer to the
primitive value, and you should be careful this does not get freed until after
the @code{NSValue} is no longer used.  You can specify to the @code{NSValue}
what type the primitive is so this information can be accessed later:

@example
int n = 10;
NSValue *theValue = [NSValue value: &n withObjCType: @@encode(int)];
  // ...
int *m = (int *) [theValue pointerValue];
@end example

Here, @code{@@encode} is a compile-time operator that converts the data type
into a string (char *) code used at runtime to refer to the type.  Object ids
can also be stored within @code{NSValue}s if desired.  Note that in the above
case, the @code{NSValue} will be pointing to invalid data once the local
variable @code{@i{n}} goes out of scope.

If you want to wrap @code{int} or other numeric values, you should use
@code{NSNumber} (a subclass of @code{NSValue}) instead.  This maintains its
own copy of the data and provides convenience methods for accessing the value
as a primitive.

@example
int n = 10;
NSNumber *theNumber = [NSNumber numberWithInt: n];
  // ...
int m = [theNumber intValue];
float f = [theNumber floatValue];  // this is also valid
@end example

Notice that @code{@i{n}}'s value is used in the initialization, not a pointer
to it.

@subsection NSNumber

@code{NSNumber} has a subclass called @code{NSDecimalNumber} that implements
a number of methods for performing decimal arithmetic to much higher
precision than supported by ordinary @code{long double}.  The behavior in
terms of rounding choices and exception handling may be customized using the
@code{NSDecimalNumberHandler} class.  Equivalent functionality to the
@code{NSDecimalNumber} class may be accessed through functions, mostly named
@code{NSDecimalXXX}.  Both the class and the functions use a structure also
called @code{NSDecimal}:

@example
typedef struct @{
  signed char	exponent;   // Signed exponent - -128 to 127
  BOOL	isNegative;         // Is this negative?
  BOOL	validNumber;        // Is this a valid number?
  unsigned char	length;	    // digits in mantissa.
  unsigned char  cMantissa[2*NSDecimalMaxDigit];
@}
@end example

Instances can be initialized using the @code{NSDecimalFromString(NSString *)}
function.

@subsection NSRange, NSPoint, NSSize, NSRect

There are also a few types (not classes) for representing common composite
structures.  @code{NSRange} represents an integer interval.  @code{NSPoint}
represents a floating point 2-d cartesian location.  @code{NSSize} represents
a 2-d floating point extent (width and height).  @code{NSRect} contains a
lower-left point and an extent.  A number of utility functions are defined
for handling rectangles and points.
@ignore
Again, why aren't these things objects?  Efficiency?
@end ignore


@section Date/Time Facilities

GNUstep contains the @code{NSDate} class and the @code{NSCalendarDate}
classes for representing and handling dates and times.  @code{NSDate} has
methods just relating to times and time differences in the abstract, but not
calendar dates or time zones.  These features are added in the
@code{NSCalendarDate} subclass.  The @code{NSTimeZone} class handles time
zone information.


@section String Manipulation and Text Processing

Basic string handling in the GNUstep Base library was covered in
@ref{Objective-C, ,Strings in GNUstep}.  Here, we introduce a number of
additional string and text processing facilities provided by GNUstep.

@subsection NSScanner and Character Sets

The @code{NSScanner} class can be thought of as providing a combination of the
capabilities of the C @code{sscanf()} function and the Java
@code{StringTokenizer} class.  It supports parsing of NSStrings and extraction
of numeric values or substrings separated by delimiters.

@code{NSScanner} works with objects of a class @code{NSCharacterSet} and its
subclasses @code{NSMutableCharacterSet}, @code{NSBitmapCharSet}, and
@code{NSMutableBitmapCharSet}, which provide various means of representing
sets of unicode characters.

@subsection Attributed Strings

@i{Attributed strings} are strings that support the association of
@i{attributes} with ranges of characters within the string.  Attributes are
name-value pairs represented by an @code{NSDictionary} and may include
standard attributes (used by GNUstep GUI classes for font and other
characteristics during rendering) as well as programmer-defined application
specific attributes.  The classes @code{NSAttributedString} and
@code{NSMutableAttributedString} represent attributed strings.  They are not
subclasses of @code{NSString}, though they bundle an instance of one.
@ignore
Need a lot more explanation -- where do you look for info on standard
attributes, what are common usage patterns, etc..
@end ignore

@subsection Formatters

@i{Formatters} are classes providing support for converting complex values
into text strings.  They also provide some support for user editing of strings
to be converted back into object equivalents.  All descend from
@code{NSFormatter}, which defines basic methods for obtaining either an
attributed string or a regular string for an object value.  Specific classes
include @code{NSDateFormatter} for @code{NSDate} objects,
@code{NSNumberFormatter} for @code{NSNumber} objects.  Instances of these
classes can be customized for specific display needs.


@section File Handling

A number of convenience facilities are provided for platform-independent
access to the file system.  The most generally useful is the
@code{NSFileManager} class, which allows you to read and save files,
create/list directories, and move or delete files and directories.  In
addition to simply listing directories, you may obtain an
@code{NSDirectoryEnumerator} instance from it, a subclass of
@code{NSEnumerator} which provides a full listing of all the files beneath a
directory and its subdirectories.

If you need to work with path names but don't need the full
@code{NSFileManager} capabilities, @code{NSString} provides a number of
path-related methods, such as @code{-stringByAppendingPathComponent:} and
@code{-lastPathComponent}.  You should use these instead of working directly
with path strings to support cross-platform portability.

@code{NSFileHandle} is a general purpose I/O class which supports reading and
writing to both files and network connections, including ordinary and
encrypted (SSL) socket connections, and the standard in / standard out streams
familiar from Unix systems.  You can obtain instances through methods
like @code{+fileHandleForReadingAtPath:(NSString *)path} and
@code{+fileHandleAsServerAtAddress:(NSString *)address service:(NSString
*)service protocol:(NSString *)protocol}.  The network-related functions of
@code{NSFileHandle} (which are a GNUstep extension not included in Cocoa) will
be covered in a later section.  Note this class also supports gzip
compression for reading and writing.

Finally, GNUstep also provides some miscellaneous filesystem-related utility
functions, including @code{NSTemporaryDirectory()} and
@code{NSHomeDirectoryForUser()}.


@section Persistence and Serialization

GNUstep provides robust facilities for persisting objects to disk or sending
them over a network connection (to implement @ref{Distributed Objects,
Distributed Objects}).  One class of facilities is referred to as @i{property
list serialization}, and is only usually used for @code{NSDictionary} and
@code{NSArray} container objects, and @code{NSNumber}, @code{NSData},
@code{NSString}, and @code{NSDate} member objects.  It utilizes primarily
text-based formats.

Saving to and loading back from a serialized property list representation will
preserve values but not necessarily the classes of the objects.  This makes
property list representations robust across platforms and library changes, but
also makes it unsuitable for certain applications.  @i{Archiving}, the second
class of GNUstep persistence facilities, provides for the persistence of a
@i{graph} of arbitrary objects, with references to one another, taking care to
only persist each individual object one time no matter how often it is
referred to.  Object class identities are preserved, so that the behavior of a
reloaded object graph is guaranteed to be the same as the saved one.  On the
other hand, the classes for these objects must be available at load time.

@subsection Property List Serialization

Serialized property list representations (sometimes referred to as
``@i{plists}'') are typically saved and restored using methods in collection
classes.  For example the @code{NSDictionary} class has
@code{-writeToFile:atomically:} to save, @code{+dictionaryWithContentsOfFile}
to restore, and @code{NSArray} has similar methods.  Alternatively, if you
wish to save/restore individual @code{NSData} or other objects, you can use
the @code{NSPropertyListSerialization} class.  (There are also
@code{NSSerializer} and @code{NSDeserializer} classes, but these are
deprecated in Mac OS X and are not really needed in GNUstep either, so should
not be used.)

Serialized property lists can actually be written in one of three different
formats -- plain text, XML, and binary.  Interconversion amongst these is
possible using the @code{pldes} and @code{plser} command-line tools (see the
@uref{../../Tools/Reference/index.html, tools reference}).
@ignore
Still need: the XML format; how to specify format in output; discussion of
compatibility with OS X; using serialization with NSData.
@end ignore

@subsection Archives

Archiving utilizes a binary format that is cross-platform between GNUstep
implementations, though not between GNUstep and Mac OS X Cocoa.  Archiving,
like serialization in Java, is used both for saving/restoring objects on disk
and for interprocess communications with @ref{Distributed Objects, Distributed
Objects}.  For an object to be archivable, it must adopt the @code{NSCoding}
protocol.  The coding process itself is managed by instances of the
@code{NSCoder} class and its subclasses:

@table @code
@item NSCoder
Base class, defines most of the interface used by the others.
@item NSArchiver, NSUnarchiver
Sequential archives that can only be saved and  restored en masse.
@item NSKeyedArchiver, NSKeyedUnarchiver
Random access archives that can be read from and written to on an
individual-object basis and provide more robust integrity in the face of
class changes.
@item NSPortCoder
Used for @ref{Distributed Objects, Distributed Objects}.
@end table

The basic approach to accessing or creating an archive is to use one of the
convenience methods in an @code{NSCoder} subclass:

@table @code
@item + (BOOL) archiveRootObject: (id)object toFile: (NSString *)file
Save object and graph below it to file.  '@code{YES}' returned on success.
Both @code{NSArchiver} and @code{NSKeyedArchiver} support.
@item + (NSData *) archivedDataWithRootObject: (id)object
Save object and graph below it to a byte buffer.  Both @code{NSArchiver} and
@code{NSKeyedArchiver} suport.
@item + (id) unarchiveObjectWithFile: (NSString *)file
Load object graph from file.  Both @code{NSUnarchiver} and
@code{NSKeyedUnarchiver} support.
@item + (id) unarchiveObjectWithData: (NSData *)data
Load object graph from byte buffer.  Both @code{NSUnarchiver} and
@code{NSKeyedUnarchiver} support.
@end table

To obtain more specialized behavior, instantiate one of the classes above and
customize it (through various method calls) before instigating the primary
archiving or unarchiving operation.

From the perspective of the objects being archived, the @code{NSCoding}
protocol declares two methods that must be implemented:

@table @code
@item -(void) encodeWithCoder: (NSCoder *)encoder
This message is sent by an @code{NSCoder} subclass or instance to request the
object to archive itself.  The implementation should send messages to
@code{encoder} to save its essential instance variables.  If this is
impossible (for whatever reason) an exception should be raised.
@item -(id) initWithCoder: (NSCoder *)decoder
This message is sent by an @code{NSCoder} subclass or instance to request the
object to restore itself from an archive.  The implementation should send
messages to @code{decoder} to load its essential instance variables.  An
exception should be raised if there is a problem restoring state.
@end table

Here is an example @code{NSCoding} implementation:

@example
@@interface City : PoliticalUnit
@{
private
float      latitude;
float      longitude;
CensusData *censusData;
State      *state;
@}

  // ...
@@end

 ...

@@implementation City

- (void) encodeWithCoder: (NSCoder *)coder
@{
  [super encodeWithCoder:coder];  // always call super first

  if (![coder allowsKeyedCoding])
    @{
      [coder encodeValueOfObjCType: @@encode(float) at: &latitude];
      [coder encodeValueOfObjCType: @@encode(float) at: &longitude];
      [coder encodeObject: censusData];
      [coder encodeConditionalObject: state];
    @}
    else
    @{
      [coder encodeFloat: latitude forKey: @@"City.latitude"];
      [coder encodeFloat: longitude forKey: @@"City.longitude"];
      [coder encodeObject: censusData forKey: @@"City.censusData"];
      [coder encodeConditionalObject: state forKey: @@"City.state"];
    @}
  return;
@}

- (id) initWithCoder: (NSCoder *)coder
@{
  self = [super initWithCoder:coder];  // always assign 'self' to super init..

  if (![coder allowsKeyedCoding])
    @{
      // Must decode keys in same order as encodeWithCoder:
      [coder decodeValueOfObjCType: @@encode(float) at: &latitude];
      [coder decodeValueOfObjCType: @@encode(float) at: &longitude];
      censusData = [[coder decodeObject] retain];
      state = [[coder decodeObject] retain];
    @}
    else
    @{
      // Can decode keys in any order
      censusData = [[coder decodeObjectForKey: @@"City.censusData"] retain];
      state = [[coder decodeObjectForKey: @@"City.state"] retain];
      latitude = [coder decodeFloatForKey: @@"City.latitude"];
      longitude = [coder decodeFloatForKey: @@"City.longitude"];
    @}
  return self;
@}

  // ...

@@end
@end example

The primary wrinkle to notice here is the check to @code{[coder
allowsKeyedCoding]}.  The object encodes and decodes its instance variables
using keys if this returns '@code{YES}'.  Keys must be unique within a single
inheritance hierarchy -- that is, a class may not use keys the same as its
superclass or any of its ancestors or sibling classes.

Keyed archiving provides robustness against class changes and is therefore to
be preferred in most cases.  For example, if instance variables are added at
some point to the @code{City} class above, this will not prevent earlier
versions of the class from restoring data from a later one (they will just
ignore the new values), nor does it prevent a later version from initializing
from an earlier archive (it will not find values for the added instance
variables, but can set these to defaults).

Finally, notice the use of @code{encodeConditionalObject} above for
@code{state}, in contrast to @code{encodeObject} for census data.  The reason
the two different methods are used is that the @code{City} object @i{owns} its
census data, which is an integral part of its structure, whereas the
@code{state} is an auxiliary reference neither owned nor retained by
@code{City}.  It should be possible to store the cities without storing the
states.  Thus, the @code{encodeConditionalObject} method is called, which
only stores the @code{State} if it is already being stored unconditionally
elsewhere during the current encoding operation.

Note that within a given archive, an object will be written only once.
Subsequent requests to write the same object are detected and a reference is
written rather than the full object.

@ignore
Mention awake, substitution on encode, etc..?
@end ignore

@section Utility

The GNUstep Base library provides a number of utility classes that don't fall
under any other function category.

The @code{NSUserDefaults} class provides access to a number of system- and
user-dependent settings that should affect tool and application behavior.  You
obtain an instance through sending @code{[NSUserDefaults
standardUserDefaults]}.  The instance provides access to settings indexed by
string keys.  The standard keys used are documented
@uref{../../../User/Gui/DefaultsSummary.html, here}.  Users can adjust
settings for particular keys using the
@i{@code{@uref{../../Tools/Reference/defaults.html, defaults}}} command.

The @code{NSProcessInfo} class provides access to certain information about
the system environment such as the operating system and host name.  It also
provides support for process logging (see @ref{Exception Handling, Logging,
Logging}).  You obtain an instance through sending @code{[NSProcessInfo
processInfo]}.

The @code{NSUndoManager} class provides a general mechanism for supporting
@i{undo} of user operations in applications.  Essentially, it allows you to
store sequences of messages and receivers that need to be invoked to undo or
redo an action.  The various methods in this class provide for grouping of
sets of actions, execution of undo or redo actions, and tuning behavior
parameters such as the size of the undo stack.  Each application entity with
its own editing history (e.g., a document) should have its own undo manager
instance.  Obtain an instance through a simple @code{[[NSUndoManager alloc]
init]} message.

The @code{NSProtocolChecker} and @code{NSProxy} classes provide message
filtering and forwarding capabilities.  If you wish to ensure at runtime that
a given object will only be sent messages in a certain protocol, you create
an @code{NSProtocolChecker} instance with the protocol and the object as
arguments:

@example
id versatileObject = [[ClassWithManyMethods alloc] init];
id narrowObject = [NSProtocolChecker protocolCheckerWithTarget: versatileObject
                                     protocol: @@protocol(SomeSpecificProtocol)];
return narrowObject;
@end example

This is often used in conjunction with distributed objects to expose only a
subset of an objects methods to remote processes.  The @code{NSProxy} class
is another class used in conjunction with distributed objects.  It implements
no methods other than basic @code{NSObject} protocol methods.  To use it,
create a subclass overriding @code{-(void) forwardInvocation:} and @code{-
(NSMethodSignature) methodForSelector:}.  By appropriate implementations
here, you can make an @code{NSProxy} subclass instance act like an instance
of any class of your choosing.
@ignore
Much more needed about this -- why is a special class needed since all
objects have a forwardInvocation method, what is -methodForSelector and do all
classes that want to implement -forwardInvocation need to implement it as
well (in which case need to add to discussion in Advanced Messaging), ...
@end ignore

The @code{NSBundle} class provides support for run-time dynamic loading of
libraries and application resources, usually termed ``Bundles''.  A bundle
consists of a top-level directory containing subdirectories that may include
images, text files, and executable binaries or shared libraries.  The ``.app''
directory holding a NeXTstep/OpenStep/GNUstep/Cocoa application is actually a
bundle, as are the ``Frameworks'' containing shared libraries together with
other resources.  Bundles and frameworks are covered in @ref{Bundles and
Frameworks}.


@section Notifications

GNUstep provides a framework for sending messages between objects within a
process called @i{notifications}.  Objects register with an
@code{NSNotificationCenter} to be informed whenever other objects post
@code{NSNotification}s to it matching certain criteria.  The notification
center processes notifications synchronously -- that is, control is only
returned to the notification poster once every recipient of the notification
has received it and processed it.  Asynchronous processing is possible using
an @code{NSNotificationQueue}.  This returns immediately when a notification
is added to it, and it will periodically post the oldest notification on its
list to the notification center.  In a multithreaded process, notifications
are always sent on the thread that they are posted from.

An @code{NSNotification} consists of a string name, an object, and optionally
a dictionary which may contain arbitrary associations.  Objects register with
the notification center to receive notifications matching either a particular
name, a particular object, or both.  When an object registers, it specifies a
message selector on itself taking an @code{NSNotification} as its sole
argument.  A message will be sent using this selector whenever the
notification center receives a matching notification in a post.

Obtain a notification center instance using @code{NSNotificationCenter
+defaultCenter}.  An @code{NSDistributedNotificationCenter} may be used for
interprocess communication on the same machine.  Interprocess notification will
be slower than within-process notification, and makes use of the
@uref{../../Tools/Reference/gdnc.html, gdnc} command-line tool.

Notifications are similar in some ways to @i{events} in other frameworks,
although they are not used for user interface component connections as in Java
(message forwarding and the target-action paradigm are used instead).  In
addition, the GNUstep GUI (AppKit) library defines an @code{NSEvent} type for
representing mouse and keyboard actions.


@section Networking and RPC

GNUstep provides some general network-related functionality, as well as
classes supporting @ref{Distributed Objects, distributed objects} and related
forms of inter-process communication.

@subsection Basic Networking

GNUstep provides the following classes handling basic network communications:

@table @code
@item NSHost
Holds and manages information on host names and IP addresses.  Use the
@code{+currentHost}, @code{+hostWithName:}, or @code{+hostWithAddress:} class
methods to obtain an instance.
@item NSFileHandle
On Unix, network connections are treated analogously to files.  This
abstraction has proven very useful, so GNUstep supports it in the
@code{NSFileHandle} class, even on non-Unix platforms.  You may use the class
methods @code{+fileHandleAsServerAtAddress:(NSString *)address
service:(NSString *)service protocol:(NSString *)protocol} and corresponding
client methods to access one side of a connection to a port on a networked
machine.  (To use pipes, see the next section.)
@item NSURL
Provides methods for working with URLs and the data accessible through them.
Once an @code{NSURL} is constructed, data may be loaded asynchronously through
@code{NSURL -loadResourceDataNotifyingClient:usingCache:} or synchronously
through @code{NSURL -resourceDataUsingCache:}.  It can also be obtained
through @code{NSString +stringWithContentsOfURL:} or @code{NSData
+dataWithContentsOfURL:}.
@item NSURLHandle
This class provides additional control over the URL contents loading
process.  Obtain an instance through @code{NSURL -URLHandleUsingCache:}.
@end table

@subsection Remote Process Communications

GNUstep provides a number of classes supporting @ref{Distributed Objects,
distributed objects} and related forms of inter-process communication.  In
most cases, you only need to know about the @code{NSConnection} class, but if
you require additional control over distributed objects, or if you wish to
use alternative forms of communications such as simple messaging, you may use
the classes listed here.

@table @code
@item NSConnection
This is the primary class used for registering and acquiring references to
distributed objects.
@item NSDistantObject
When a client acquires a remote object reference through @code{NSConnection
+rootProxyForConnectionWithRegisteredName:}, the returned object is an
instance of this class, which is a subclass of @code{NSProxy}.  Since usually
you will just cast your reference to this to a particular protocol, you do
not need to refer to the @code{NSDistantObject} class directly.
@item NSPort, NSPortMessage
Behind the scenes in distributed objects, @code{NSPort} objects handle both
network communications and serialization/deserialization for
sending messages to remote objects and receiving the results.  The actual
data sent over the network is encapsulated by @code{NSPortMessage} objects,
which consist of two ports (sender and receiver) and a body consisting of one
or more @code{NSData} or @code{NSPort} objects.  (Data in the @code{NSData}
must be in network byte order.)
@item NSSocketPort, NSMessagePort
If you want to send custom messages between processes yourself, you can use
these classes.  @code{NSSocketPort} can communicate to processes on the same
or remote machines.  @code{NSMessagePort} is optimized for local
communications only.
@item NSPortNameServer, NSSocketPortNameServer, NSMessagePortNameServer
The @code{NSPortNameServer} class and subclasses are used behind the scenes
by the distributed objects system to register and look up remotely-accessible
objects.
@end table


@section Threads and Run Control

A GNUstep program may initiate independent processing in two ways -- it can
start up a separate process, referred to as a @i{task}, much like a @i{fork}
in Unix, or it may spawn multiple @i{threads} within a single process.
Threads share data, tasks do not.  Before discussing tasks and threads, we
first describe the @i{run loop} in GNUstep programs.

@subsection Run Loops and Timers

@code{NSRunLoop} instances handle various utility tasks that must be performed
repetitively in an application, such as processing input events, listening for
distributed objects communications, firing @code{NSTimer}s, and sending
notifications and other messages asynchronously.  In general, there is one run
loop per thread in an application, which may always be obtained through the
@code{+currentRunLoop} method, however unless you are using the AppKit and the
[NSApplication] class, the run loop will not be started unless you explicitly
send it a @code{-run} message.

At any given point, a run loop operates in a single @i{mode}, usually
@code{NSDefaultRunLoopMode}.  Other modes are used for special purposes and
you usually need not worry about them.

An @code{NSTimer} provides a way to send a message at some time in the future,
possibly repeating every time a fixed interval has passed.  To use a timer,
you can either create one that will automatically be added to the run loop in
the current thread (using the @code{-addTimer:forMode:} method), or you can
create it without adding it then add it to a run loop of your choosing later.

@subsection Tasks and Pipes

You can run another program as a subprocess using an @code{NSTask} instance,
and communicate with it using @code{NSPipe} instances.  The following code
illustrates.

@example
NSTask *task = [[NSTask alloc] init];
NSPipe *pipe = [NSPipe pipe];
NSFileHandle *readHandle = [pipe fileHandleForReading];
NSData *inData = nil;

[task setStandardOutput: pipe]; 
[task setLaunchPath: [NSHomeDirectory()
                         stringByAppendingPathComponent:@@"bin/someBinary"]];
[task launch];

while ((inData = [readHandle availableData]) && [inData length])
  @{
    [self processData:inData];
  @}
[task release];
@end example

Here, we just assume the task has exited when it has finished sending output.
If this might not be the case, you can register an observer for
@ref{Base Library, notifications, Notifications} named
@code{NSTaskDidTerminateNotification}.


@subsection Threads and Locks

@i{Threads} provide a way for applications to execute multiple tasks in
parallel.  Unlike separate processes, all threads of a program share the same
memory space, and therefore may access the same objects and variables.

GNUstep supports multithreaded applications in a convenient manner through the
@code{NSThread} and @code{NSLock} classes and subclasses.  @code{NSThread
+detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:} allows you to initiate a new
thread and cause a message to be sent to an object on that thread.  The thread
can either run in a ``one-shot'' manner or it can sit in loop mode (starting
up its own instance of the @code{NSRunLoop} class) and communicate with other
threads using part of the @ref{Distributed Objects, distributed objects}
framework.  Each thread has a dictionary (accessed through
@code{-threadDictionary} that allows for storage of thread-local variables.

Because threads share data, there is the danger that examinations of and
modifications to data performed concurrently by more than one thread will
occur in the wrong order and produce unexpected results.  (Operations with
immutable objects do not present this problem unless they are actually
deallocated.)  GNUstep provides the @code{@i{NSLocking}} protocol and the
@code{NSLock} class and subclasses to deal with this.  @code{@i{NSLocking}}
provides two methods: @code{-lock} and @code{-unlock}.  When an operation
needs to be performed without interference, enclose it inside of lock-unlock:

@example
NSArray *myArray;
NSLock *myLock = [[NSLock alloc] init];
  // ...
[myLock lock];
if (myArray == nil)
  @{
    myAray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    [myArray addObject: someObject];
  @}
[myLock unlock];
@end example

This code protects '@code{myArray}' from accidentally being initialized twice
if two separate threads happen to detect it is @code{nil} around the same
time.  When the @code{lock} method is called, the thread doing so is said to
@i{acquire} the lock.  No other thread may subsequently acquire the lock
until this one has subsequently @i{relinquished} the lock, by calling
@code{unlock}.

Note that the lock object should be initialized @i{before} any thread might
possibly need it.  Thus, you should either do it before any additional threads
are created in the application, or you should enclose the lock creation inside
of another, existing, lock.

The @code{-lock} method in the @code{@i{NSLocking}} protocol blocks
indefinitely until the lock is acquired.  If you would prefer to just check
whether the lock can be acquired without committing to this, you can use
@code{NSLock -tryLock} or @code{NSLock -lockBeforeDate:}, which return
@code{YES} if they succeed in acquiring the lock.

@code{NSRecursiveLock} is an @code{NSLock} subclass that may be locked
multiple times by the same thread.  (The @code{NSLock} implementation will
not allow this, causing the thread to deadlock (freeze) when it attempts to
acquire the lock a second time.)  Each @code{lock} message must be balanced
by a corresponding @code{unlock} before the lock is relinquished.

@code{NSConditionLock} stores an @code{int} together with its lock status.
The @code{-lockWhenCondition:(int)value} and related methods request the lock
only if the condition is equal to that passed in.  The condition may be
changed using the @code{unlockWithCondition:(int)value} method.  This
mechanism is useful for, e.g., a producer-consumer situation, where the
producer can ``tell'' the consumer that data is available by setting the
condition appropriately when it releases the lock it acquired for adding data.

Finally, the @code{NSDistributedLock} class does not adopt the
@code{@i{NSLocking}} protocol but supports locking across processes, including
processes on different machines, as long as they can access a common
filesystem.

If you are writing a class library and do not know whether it will be used in
a multithreaded environment or not, and would like to avoid locking overhead
if not, use the @code{NSThread +isMultiThreaded} method.  You can also
register to receive @code{NSWillBecomeMultiThreadedNotification}s.

@subsection Using @code{NSConnection} to Communicate Between Threads

You can use the distributed objects framework to communicate between threads.
This can help avoid creating threads repeatedly for the same operation, for
example.  While you can go through the full process of registering a server
object by name as described in @ref{Distributed Objects, distributed
objects}, a lighter weight approach is to create @code{NSConnection}s
manually:

@example
  // code in Master...
- startSlave
@{
  NSPort *master;
  NSPort *slave;
  NSArray *ports;
  NSConnection *comms;

  master = [NSPort port];
  slave  = [NSPort port];

  comms = [[NSConnection alloc] initWithReceivePort: master sendPort: slave];
  [comms setRootObject: self];

  portArray = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: slave, master, nil];

  [NSThread detachNewThreadSelector: @@selector(newWithCommPorts:)
                           toTarget: [Slave class]
                         withObject: ports];
@}

  // code in Slave...
+ newWithCommPorts: (NSArray *)ports
@{
  NSConnection *comms;

  NSPort *slave  = [ports objectAtIndex: 0];
  NSPort *master = [ports objectAtIndex: 1];

  comms = [NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort: slave sendPort: master];

  // create instance and assign to 'self'
  self = [[self alloc] init];

  [(id)[comms rootProxy] setServer: self];
  [self release];

  [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run];
@}

@end example


@section GNUstep Additions

The @uref{../../BaseAdditions/Reference/index.html, Base Additions} library
consists of a number of classes, all beginning with '@code{GC}' or
'@code{GS}', that are not specified in OpenStep or Cocoa but have been deemed
to be of general utility by the GNUstep developers.  The library is designed
so that it can be built and installed on a system, such as OS X, where GNUstep
is not available but an alternate Foundation implementation is.

It contains the following categories of classes:

@table @code

@item GSXMLxxx
Classes for parsing XML using DOM- or SAX-like APIs, for processing XPath
expressions, and for performing XSLT transforms.  These are implemented over
the @uref{http://xmlsoft.org, libxml2} C library, and using them should for
the most part protect you from the frequent API changes in that library.

@item GSHtmlXxx
Classes for parsing HTML documents (not necessarily XHTML).

@item GSMimeXxx
Classes for handling MIME messages or HTML POST documents.

@end table

All of these classes have excellent API reference documentation and you
should look @uref{../../BaseAdditions/Reference/index.html, there} for
further information.
