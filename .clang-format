# Modified from gcc's clang-format config.

# clang-format 7.0.1 is required
#
# To utilize the tool to lines just touched by a patch, use
# clang-format-diff script that is usually also packaged with clang-format.
#
# Example of usage:
# git diff -U0 --no-color | clang-format-diff -p1
# (here the tool will generate a patch)
# git diff -U0 --no-color | clang-format-diff -p1 -i
# (modifications are applied)
