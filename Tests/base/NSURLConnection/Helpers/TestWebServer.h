 *
 *  TestWebServer is intended to be used in the tests where a web service is
 *  needed. The class's instance is instantiated with the method
 *  -[initWithAddress:port:mode:extra] and then started with the call -[start:].
 *  When started the TestWebServer starts in it's turn a SimpleWebServer instance
 *  in the same thread unless it is initialized with the argument 'mode' set to
 *  'YES' to run it in a detached thread.
 *
 *  It is designed to call the delegate's callbacks (if implemented) of
 *  the TestWebServerDelegate protocol for every request made to
 *  the SimpleWebServer's assigned address on the SimpleWebServer's assigned port
 *  (by default localhost and 1234 respectively). However it currently doesn't
 *  handle any request on it's own. Instead the class uses a collection of
 *  handlers. Every handler makes a custom response. So the TestWebServer only
 *  has to dispatch a request to a corresponding handler and then to send back
 *  the handler's response to the SimpleWebServer instance. See RequestHandler
 *  for more information.
 *
 *  TestWebServer can be supplied with additional parameters via the argument
 *  'extra' of the initializer -[initWithAddress:port:mode:extra].
 *  See that method's description for the currently supported key-value pairs.
 *
 *  The pattern of use:
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  NSDictionary *extra = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
 *                                      @"https", @"Protocol",
 *                                      nil];
 *  TestWebServer *server = [[TestWebServer alloc] initWithAddress: @"localhost"
 *                                                            port: @"1234"
 *                                                            mode: NO
 *                                                           extra: extra];
 *  ADelegateClass *del = [ADelegateClass new];
 *  [server setDelegate: del];
 *  [server start: extra];
 *  ....
 *  <runloop>
 *  ....
 *  [server stop];
 *  DESTROY(server);
 *  DESTROY(del);
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *
 *  The TestWebServer can response to the following resource paths:
 *
 *      /index
 *            displays the page with all supported resources
 *      /withoutauth/
 *            if it is a part of the request's URL then the TestWebServer
 *            will NOT check authentication/authorization of the client.
 *
 *      /204/
 *      /301/
 *      /400/
 *      /401/
 *      /402/
 *      /404/
 *      /405/
 *      /409/
 *      /500/
 *      /505/
 *      /507/
 *            a try to access to this resources will lead the TestWebServer
 *            to produce one of the pre-defined responses with the status code
 *            is equal to the corresponding number.
 *            The pre-defined responses are:
 *              204 "" (empty string)
 *              301 "Redirect to <URL>"
 *                  Returns in the header 'Location' a new <URL> which by default
 *                  has the same protocol, address but the port is incremented by
 *                  1 (e.g. http://localhost:1235/ with other parameters set to
 *                  their default values).
 *              400 "You have issued a request with invalid data"
 *              401 "Invalid login or password"
 *              403 "Check your balance"
 *              404 "The resource you are trying to access is not found"
 *              405 "You can't do that"
 *              409 "The resource you are trying to access is busy"
 *              500 "System error"
 *              505 "There is network protocol inconsistency"
 *              507 "Insufficient storage"
 *
 *  If you want more verbosity call the method -[setDebug: YES].
