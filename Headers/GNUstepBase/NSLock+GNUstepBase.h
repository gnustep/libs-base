 * Returns IDENT which will be initialized

 * IDENT is considered uninitialized, if it contains nil.
 * CLASSNAME must be either NSLock, NSRecursiveLock or one
 * of their subclasses.
 * See [NSLock(GNUstepBase)+newLockAt:] for details.
 * This macro is intended for code that cannot insure
 * that a lock can be initialized in thread safe manner otherwise.
 * <example>
 * NSLock *my_lock = nil;
 *
 * void function (void)
 * {
 *   [GS_INITIALIZED_LOCK(my_lock, NSLock) lock];
 *   do_work ();
 *   [my_lock unlock];
