#ifdef GSDIAGNOSE

/**
   <p>NSDebugLLog() is the basic debug logging macro used to display
   log messages using NSLog(), if debug logging was enabled at compile
   time and the appropriate logging key was set at runtime.
   </p>
   <p>Debug logging which can be enabled/disabled by defining GSDIAGNOSE
   when compiling and also setting values in the mutable set which
   is set up by NSProcessInfo. GSDIAGNOSE is defined automatically
   unless diagnose=no is specified in the make arguments.
   </p>
   <p>NSProcess initialises a set of strings that are the names of active
   debug keys using the '--GNU-Debug=...' command line argument.
   Each command-line argument of that form is removed from
   <code>NSProcessInfo</code>'s list of arguments and the variable part
   (...) is added to the set.
   This means that as far as the program proper is concerned, it is
   running with the same arguments as if debugging had not been enabled.
   </p>
   <p>For instance, to debug the NSBundle class, run your program with 
    '--GNU-Debug=NSBundle'
   You can of course supply multiple '--GNU-Debug=...' arguments to
   output debug information on more than one thing.
   </p>
   <p>NSUserDefaults also adds debug keys from the array given by the
   GNU-Debug default ... but these values will not take effect until the
   +standardUserDefaults method is called ... so they are useless for
   debugging NSUserDefaults itself or for debugging any code executed
   before the defaults system is used.
   </p>
   <p>To embed debug logging in your code you use the NSDebugLLog() or
   NSDebugLog() macro.  NSDebugLog() is just NSDebugLLog() with the debug
   key set to 'dflt'.  So, to activate debug statements that use
   NSDebugLog(), you supply the '--GNU-Debug=dflt' argument to your program.
   </p>
   <p>You can also change the active debug keys under your programs control -
   NSProcessInfo has a [-debugSet] method that returns the mutable set that
   contains the active debug keys - your program can modify this set.
   </p>
   <p>Two debug keys have a special effect - 'dflt' is the key used for
   debug logs statements where no debug key is specified, and 'NoWarn'
   is used to *disable* warning messages.
   </p>
   <p>As a convenience, there are four more logging macros you can use -
   NSDebugFLog(), NSDebugFLLog(), NSDebugMLog() and NSDebugMLLog().
   These are the same as the other macros, but are specifically for use in
   either functions or methods and prepend information about the file, line
   and either function or class/method in which the message was generated.
   </p>

/**
   <p>NSWarnLog() is the basic debug logging macro used to display

   </p>
   <p>Warning messages which can be enabled/disabled by defining GSWARN

   </p>
   <p>You can also disable these messages at runtime by supplying a
   '--GNU-Debug=NoWarn' argument to the program, or by adding 'NoWarn'
   to the user default array named 'GNU-Debug'.
   </p>
   <p>These logging macros are intended to be used when the software detects
   something that it not necessarily fatal or illegal, but looks like it
   might be a programming error.  eg. attempting to remove 'nil' from an
   NSArray, which the Spec/documentation does not prohibit, but which a
   well written program should not be attempting (since an NSArray object
   cannot contain a 'nil').
   </p>
   <p>NB. The 'warn=yes' option is understood by the GNUstep make package
   to mean that GSWARN should be defined, and the 'warn=no' means that
   GSWARN should be undefined.  Default is to define it.
