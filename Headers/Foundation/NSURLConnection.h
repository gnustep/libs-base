/**
 * This category is an informal protocol specifying how an NSURLConnection
 * instance will communicate with its delegate to inform it of (and allow
 * it to manage) the progress of a load request.<br />
 * A load operation is performed by asynchronous I/O using the
 * run loop of the thread in which it was initiated, so all callbacks
 * will occur in that thread.<br />
 * The process of loading a resource occurs as follows -<br />
 * <list>
 *   <item>
 *     Any number of -connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:
 *     messages may be sent to the delegate before any other messages
 *     in this list are sent.  This permits a chain of redirects to
 *     be followed before eventual loading of 'real' data.
 *   </item>
 *   <item>
 *     A -connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: message may be
 *     sent to the delegate (where authentication is required) before
 *     response data can be downloaded.
 *   </item>
 *   <item>
 *     Any number of -connection:didReceiveResponse: messages
 *     may be be sent to the delegate before a
 *     -connection:didReceiveData: message.  Usually there is exactly one
 *     of these, but for multipart/x-mixed-replace there may be multiple
 *     responses for each part, and if an error occurs in the download
 *     the delegate may not receive a response at all.<br />
 *     Delegates should discard previously handled data when they
 *     receive a new response.
 *   </item>
 *   <item>
 *     Any number of -connection:didReceiveData: messages may
 *     be sent before the load completes as described below.
 *   </item>
 *   <item>
 *     A single -connection:willCacheResponse: message may
 *     be sent to the delegate after any -connection:didReceiveData:
 *     messages are sent but before a -connectionDidFinishLoading: message
 *     is sent.
 *   </item>
 *   <item>
 *     Unless the NSURLConnection receives a -cancel message,
 *     the delegate will receive one and only one of
 *     -connectionDidFinishLoading:, or
 *     -connection:didFailWithError: message, but never
 *     both.<br />
 *     Once either of these terminal messages is sent the
 *     delegate will receive no further messages from the 
 *     NSURLConnection.
 *   </item>
 * </list>
