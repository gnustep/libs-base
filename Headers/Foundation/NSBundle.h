   <p>
   NSBundle provides methods for locating and handling application (and tool)
   resources at runtime. Resources includes any time of file that the
   application might need, such as images, nib (gorm or gmodel) files,
   localization files, and any other type of file that an application
   might need to use to function. Resources also include executable
   code, which can be dynamically linked into the application at
   runtime. These files and executable code are commonly put together
   into a directory called a bundle.
   </p>
   <p>
   NSBundle knows how these bundles are organized and can search for
   files inside a bundle. NSBundle also handles locating the
   executable code, linking this in and initializing any classes that
   are located in the code. NSBundle also handles Frameworks, which are
   basically a bundle that contains a library archive. The
   organization of a framework is a little difference, but in most
   respects there is no difference between a bundle and a framework.
   </p>
   <p>
   There is one special bundle, called the mainBundle, which is
   basically the application itself. The mainBundle is always loaded
   (of course), but you can still perform other operations on the
   mainBundle, such as searching for files, just as with any other
   bundle.

 *   tools and added as a comment before the string to
 *   translate.  Upon finding something like

 *   help the translator to decide how to translate when it is
 *   not clear how to translate (because the original string is
 *   now out of context, and out of context might not be so
 *   clear what the string means).  The comment is totally
 *   ignored by the library code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   If you don't have a comment (because the string is so
