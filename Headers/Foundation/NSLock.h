 * <p>Simplest lock for protecting critical sections of code.

 * <p>An <code>NSLock</code> is used in multi-threaded applications to protect
 * critical pieces of code. While one thread holds a lock within a piece of
 * code, another thread cannot execute that code until the first thread has
 * given up its hold on the lock. The limitation of <code>NSLock</code> is
 * that you can only lock an <code>NSLock</code> once and it must be unlocked
 * before it can be acquired again.<br /> Other lock classes, notably
 * [NSRecursiveLock], have different restrictions.
